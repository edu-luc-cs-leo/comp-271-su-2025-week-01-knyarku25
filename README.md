# COMP 271 SU25 WEEK 01


# Explain
Explain in your own words the use of `arr.length` as an index for array `temporary` in line 83 of `Realistic.java` in this repository.

You may type your answers in a **block comment** at the top of class `Realistic.java` or as a new markdown file in this repository -- in this case, the new file should be name `explain.md`. This is a good opportunity to familiarize yourself with [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

# Code
Modify method `Realistic.remove()` to return an [`Integer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html) with the smallest element in the primary array `arr` it or `null` when the array is empty. Class `Integer` is an object version of the primitive `int` type. By wrapping a priminte in an object, we can customize its behavior in ways that are not possible otherwise.
